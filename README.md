## Future Enhancements

+ Include a restaurant show page where users can get detailed information about a restaurant and add/delete it from their favorite restaurants list.

+ Adjust functionality for adding a contact so that one user sends a request to another that must be accepted before they become contacts.

+ Absord third-party API to acquire information about restaurants, including location, menu, and website.

+ Change the home page into a "feed" that algorithmically determines what content is prioritized for a user based on their restaurant and dish preferences, contacts, past posts, etc.
